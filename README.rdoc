= rODF

This is a library for writing to ODF output with Ruby. It currently only
supports creating spreadsheets (ODS) and text documents (ODT). Slide shows (ODP)
may be added some time in the future.

This is NOT an ODF reading library.

=== Installation

You should be able to install the latest stable version by saying something like

  sudo gem install rodf

=== How do I use it?

rODF works pretty much like Builder, but with ODF-aware constructs. Try this:

  require 'odf/spreadsheet'

  ODF::Spreadsheet.file("my-spreadsheet.ods") do
    table 'My first table from Ruby' do
      row {cell 'Hello, rODF world!' }
    end
  end

Some basic formatting is also possible:

  require 'odf/spreadsheet'

  ODF::Spreadsheet.file("my-spreadsheet.ods") do
    style 'red-cell', :family => :cell do
      property :text, 'font-weight' => 'bold', 'color' => '#ff0000'
    end
    table 'Red text table' do
      row {cell 'Red', :style => 'red-cell' }
    end
  end
